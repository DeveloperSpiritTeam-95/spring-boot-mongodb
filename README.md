# spring-boot-mongodb

The spring-boot-mongodb project integrates Spring Boot with MongoDB to create a scalable and flexible application for managing data in a NoSQL database. It demonstrates essential CRUD operations, schema design, and repository pattern using Spring Data MongoDB. This project serves as a practical example of how to leverage MongoDB's powerful features within a Spring Boot application, providing a robust solution for handling large volumes of unstructured data.
